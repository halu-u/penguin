        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi, I'm Ren. I love creating, learning about anything.<br>
            In my free time, I enjoy OS development, malware analysis, and 3D modeling with Blender.<br><br>
            Discord: 0x5a4d.<br>
            (REMEMBER DOT IS REQUIRED.)<br><br>
            I don't speak English well.<br>
            (But I use an US keyboard. Because I don't have to use different KANJI, KATAKANA, and HIRAGANA.)

            <h3>Electronics</h3>
            <p>Offline task processing with voice recognition.<br>
                (mainly data management by using SQLite3 and QR Codes)</p>

            <h3>Modeling with Blender</h3>
            <p>I would like to create a world in VRChat about the death of people and things that are invisible in everyday life.<br>
                but it's going to be a long road as I can't make animations and textures right yet.

            <h3>OS Development</h3>
            <p>This is just a hobby for me.<br>
                Right now, it only runs on QEMU, and since it is a 32-bit architecture, it is not practical, and that is where I would like to improve.<br>
                Even if I understood, it probably feel a sense of emptiness, wondering what I had learned the hard way...
